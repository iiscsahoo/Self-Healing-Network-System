# Self-Healing-Network-System
SDN/NFV and Traditional Network: Automation &amp; Troubleshooting (SHNS)

The Self-Healing Network System has various levels of objectives as shown below:

Level 1: 
Self-Healing Network System (SHNS) will be a front-end orchestration application to manage, automate, and troubleshoot Software Defined Network (SDN) and multivendor traditional networks. A monitoring system will be built that collects data, monitors the “global” (SDN and traditional) network, and sends alerts to the self-healing dashboard in case of any discrepancy.

Level 2: 
In addition to the level 1 criteria, a front-end dashboard will be created that displays alerts received from the monitoring system. The dashboard also provides additional features like extracting specific information from both the networks for further optimization.

Level 3: 
In addition to the level 2 criteria, a backend script with self-healing features will be developed. SHNS will address both troubleshooting as well as failure issues. Some examples of partial and complete failure issues are delay, latency, congestion, DHCP misconfiguration, peering instabilities, device/container failures, CPU and memory utilization exceeding a threshold value. We will be addressing similar issues in our SHNS.

Level 4: 
In addition to the level 3 criteria, SHNS will not only address the known issues using predefined objects, but also, search for unknown security vulnerabilities, learn about new threats and additionally recover the whole networking system from cyber threats i.e. malware, denial-of-service and so forth. Moreover, SHNS will patch its own flaws, reducing the security attacks related to broken authentication and network session management or sensitive data exposure.
